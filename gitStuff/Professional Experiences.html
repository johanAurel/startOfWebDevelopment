     <h1>My Professional Experiences</h1><hr>

</head>
For the my professional experiences ,unfortunately I have just been volunteering but I am currently
trying to get into a security oriented job for flexibility.
<p>Nevertheless, my experiences well gratifying and building. They are as follows:<br/>
<ul>
 <li>I volunteered as barista and Head waiter in Gyros for a period of <b>3 months.</b></n>
Where I learned very intensively how important and practical a good customer support can be.</n><br/>
I learned how to be self driven and how to work as part of a team and through all the responsibilities entrusted to me I eventually learned how to be a reliable leader.</li>
 <li>I also assisted in the local baptist church with teaching english as a second language to people willing and obviously needing to for a better integration and start in an english speaking system of life.<br/>
 I did that for about <b>a year</b></li>

</ul>
